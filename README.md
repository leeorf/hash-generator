# Why this?

This script was mainly made for the sake of having a way to retrieve a sha1 from a string without exposing the string that will be encrypted. I've done this because I rely on some sha1 hashes to access some files at work and I don't want to expose those strings and hashes when I'm in a video call or doing some pair programming
